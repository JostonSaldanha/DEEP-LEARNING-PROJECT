## Detailed description of the task

### Objective

This deep learning project focuses on developing an image classification model to identify bird species from images. The primary objective is to build an AI-driven system capable of recognizing and classifying various bird species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project involves multiple phases, including data preparation, augmentation, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Bird species classification is an important application in various domains such as wildlife conservation, ecological studies, and environmental monitoring. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the developed AI-powered system will provide researchers and bird enthusiasts with an efficient tool for species identification, thereby contributing to biodiversity assessments and species protection efforts.

The model is built using multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization and pooling layers to extract meaningful features from images. It is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and optimized with the Adam optimizer to achieve high classification accuracy. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics, ensuring its practical utility for real-world applications.

### Steps Performed in the Task

#### 1.Data Preparation

The dataset is structured into training, testing, and validation sets. The images are preprocessed using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory to create batches:

train_dataset = image_dataset_from_directory("data/train", image_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32)
test_dataset = image_dataset_from_directory("data/test", image_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32)
valid_dataset = image_dataset_from_directory("data/valid", image_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32)

#### 2.Data Augmentation

Data augmentation improves the model’s ability to generalize by applying transformations such as flipping, rotation, and zooming:

from tensorflow.keras import layers

data_augmentation = keras.Sequential([
    layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
    layers.RandomRotation(0.2),
    layers.RandomZoom(0.4),
])

#### 3.Model Architecture

Conv2D layers: Extract features from images.

BatchNormalization: Normalize feature maps to stabilize learning.

MaxPooling2D: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining essential information.

GlobalAveragePooling2D: Reduce feature maps before classification.

Dropout Layer: Prevent overfitting.

The model consists of 6 key layers:

Data Augmentation & Preprocessing Layer: Performs transformations and rescales images.

First Convolutional Block: Conv2D (32 filters) + BatchNormalization + MaxPooling.

Second Convolutional Block: Conv2D (64 filters) + BatchNormalization + MaxPooling.

Third Convolutional Block: Conv2D (128 filters) + BatchNormalization + MaxPooling.

Fourth Convolutional Block: Conv2D (256 filters) + BatchNormalization + MaxPooling.

Fully Connected Layer: GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dropout + Dense (525 classes with softmax activation).


#### 4.Compilation and training

The model is compiled using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class classification) and Adam optimizer.

model.compile(loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
              optimizer="adam",
              metrics=["accuracy"])


#### 5. Model Evaluation and Visualization

After training, loss and accuracy trends are evaluated of the model:
Accuracy:87.59% 
loss: 0.4466
